Full osd's:
- ceph osd tree
- ceph health detail
- ceph pg dump
- ceph osd dump

Copy of the crushmap.

1. Consider changing full ratio: ceph pg set_full_ratio 0.98
2. If OSD's can not start at all, manually delete placement group directories in: /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-x/current/ (where "ceph-x" is the osd number that is shown as down)

NOTE: Be careful when deleting directories, only do so from one OSD and make sure a copy always exists on at least one other OSD!!

Slow Requests:

- Verify requests are not slow on only specific OSDs / hosts, for example by running the below and comparing the output against the osd tree:

grep 'slow request' ceph.log | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
