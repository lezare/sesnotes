A. On the OSD node:

1. Rotate the salt log:

:~ # logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/salt

2. Enable salt minion debug logging on the OSD host. To do this, edit "/etc/salt/minion" and unremark and set this line:

log_level_logfile: debug

3. Restart the salt-minion service (systemctl restart salt-minion.service)

B. On the Admin node:

1. Attempt to deploy the OSDs by running specifically against the OSD node:

:~ # salt-run disks.deploy target='*XXX*' | tee disks_deploy.out
