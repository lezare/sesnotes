## Gigagyte and binary
1 Gigabyte:
A gigabyte (decimal) contains 1000^3 bytes. This is the common usage compared to a gigabyte (binary) or a gibibyte that contains 1024^3 bytes.
1 Gibibyte:
A gibibyte contains 1024^3 bytes, this is the same as a binary gigabyte. It is similar but not equal to the common gigabyte (decimal) that contains 1000^3 bytes

## Full osd's:
- ceph osd tree
- ceph health detail
- ceph pg dump
- ceph osd dump

## Copy of the crushmap.

1. Consider changing full ratio: ceph pg set_full_ratio 0.98
2. If OSD's can not start at all, manually delete placement group directories in: /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-x/current/ (where "ceph-x" is the osd number that is shown as down)

NOTE: Be careful when deleting directories, only do so from one OSD and make sure a copy always exists on at least one other OSD!!

## Slow Requests:

- Verify requests are not slow on only specific OSDs / hosts, for example by running the below and comparing the output against the osd tree:

 :~> grep 'slow request' ceph.log | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

## Admin keyring CAPS messed up:

Re-set the caps using the mon keyring e.g.;

cd /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-`$hostname -s`\
ceph -n mon. --keyring keyring auth caps client.admin mds 'allow *' osd 'allow *' mon 'allow *' mgr 'allow *'

## Inconsistent PG / Scrub Error

 :~> ceph pg deep-scrub <pg_id>
 :~> ceph -w | grep <pg_id>
 :~> rados list-inconsistent-obj <pg_id> --format=json-pretty

Depending on the results, we can then decide if forcing a repair with the below command will be okay:

Â :~> ceph pg repair <pg_id>

## 6 Debug logs:

 :~> ceph tell mon.$(hostname) injectargs --debug-ms 1

or in the conf and restart relevant service:

debug ms = 1

## Get MON/MGR Status from the socket:

MON:
 :~> ceph --admin-daemon /var/run/ceph/ceph-mon.`hostname`.asok quorum_status

MGR:
 :~> ceph --admin-daemon /var/run/ceph/ceph-mgr.`hostname`.asok status
